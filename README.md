MINESWEEPER! Did you run Windows in the '90s? Then you already know!
===

Minesweeper clone in Ruby
---

### Getting Started

1.  Load minesweeper.rb!

### Controls

*  Enter pairs of whitespace separated coordinates (e.g. "3 7") to inspect a space on the board. If the space contains a mine, you lose. If it's empty, it will either reveal an empty space or an integer representing the number of adjacent mines.
*  Start your input with the letter "f" to flag a space you think might be a flag ("f 3 7").
*  To win, clear all of the empty spaces on the board!

### Goals

*  Practice Ruby
*  Nostalgia
